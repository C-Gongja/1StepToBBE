# 1StepToB Backend	
It is backend server of 1StepToB, built using 
flask + ariadne (GraphQL)

## Why Flask, Ariadne, and MongoDB?
- Easy for fast prototyping.
* Flask: Light and flexible web framework ideal for building APIs quickly.
* Ariadne: Simple GraphQL implementation in Python with a `schema-first` approach. With schema-first, it makes it easy to alternate coding between frontend and backend. I also wanted to learn more about schemas.
* MongoDB: A schema-less, document-based database that works well with GraphQL and speeds up development.
